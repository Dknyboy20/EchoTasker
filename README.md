# EchoTasker
Amazon Echo skill that sends an AutoRemote message to tasker with your speech. You can also use it to send SMS messages from the Echo with Tasker.

Let me note first that I don't know any programming languages, this type of stuff has always been a hobby and interesting to me. I was reading through the examples Amazon gives you for setting up a skill and around the same time came across and set up the Sonos skill found here: https://github.com/rgraciano/echo-sonos
It's an awesome skill, works great to control your Sonos stuff from the Echo so check it out as well. After setting it up I started reading through his files and just set up a duplicate on my Echo with a different name, then started modifying them to get a feel for how it worked. So long story short since I don't have a full grasp of what all the code does there are a lot of extra steps left over in this skill that don't need to be there since I just modified and copied/pasted from other skills. I'm still reading up on Echo skills and javascript and have a lot I'd like to add to this as I get time. But it does work well as is. Anyone who actually knows what they are doing please feel free to clean this up a bit and help me learn something by explaining what you did or why it works that way.
